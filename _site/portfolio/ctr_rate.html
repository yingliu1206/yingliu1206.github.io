                                                    <hr style="border-top: dashed 2px #964B00;">

                                                <h2 style = "font-size: 23px">Background</h2>
                                                    <p style = "font-size: 16px">An online advertising company has two main types of ads on its website: contextual ads and non-contextual ads.</p>

                                                <h2 style = "font-size: 23px">Goal</h2>
                                                    <p style = "font-size: 16px">The goal of the project is to study the factors that affect the click event so that the company can improve service quality and increase the click rate. By enhancing these aspects, the company aims to bring more benefits for product companies and ultimately attract more customers to post these two kinds of advertisements on their website.</p>

                                                <h2 style = "font-size: 23px">Methodology</h2>
                                                    <p style = "font-size: 16px">Firstly, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on ads and users information to identify patterns and relationships among variables. Subsequently, the datasets were merged, missing values were deleted, and the merged dataset was prepared for training a logistic regression model. As it was a binary classification problem, variables such as 'AdID', 'Position', 'HistCTR', 'CategoryID', 'Price', and 'Title' were included in the logistic regression model.</p>

                                                <h2 style = "font-size: 23px">Results</h2>
                                                    <p style = "font-size: 16px">The analysis revealed that product companies of category '34' were the largest customers of the online advertising company, and non-contextual ads mostly targeted location '3953' and '3960'. The most popular browser family among users was '25' and the most common device was '2014'. The logistic regression model, with features such as position of the ad, history-based estimation of click-through rate, type of ads, price for an ad, and ad title, can be used to predict the click event with reasonable accuracy.</p>

                                                <h2 style = "font-size: 23px">Future work</h2>
                                                    <p style = "font-size: 16px">Future work can focus on finding the missing column that recorded user's phone request in the data 'combined_stream'. This information can be used as the label class to research the important factors that may affect the click event on non-contextual ads.</p>

For contextual ads, data 'search_click' and 'ad_info' were joined to form a merged dataset with 7 unique fields, while data 'combined_stream', 'ad_info', and 'search_info' were joined to form a merged dataset for non-contextual ads. The goal was to build a clickthrough rate prediction model for both contextual and non-contextual ads.</p>

The feature columns were combined using VectorAssembler, and a Pipeline was used to specify the machine learning workflow.</p>

                                                <p style = "font-size: 16px">After conducting the EDA analysis, several key findings were identified. The online advertising company had a total of 36,892,885 ads, with an average price of approximately 4,651,622.64 dollars. Category 19 had the highest average price of ads, while category 8 had the lowest. Category 34 ads were the most popular, while category 8 ads had the fewest customers. The company may need to adjust the promotion mode for category 8 ads to improve their visibility.</p>
                                                <p style = "font-size: 16px">Non-contextual ads primarily targeted locations 3953 and 3960, with the highest average price of non-contextual ads at location 3682. The most commonly used browser family was type 25, and the most commonly used device was type 2014. The company can compare the attractiveness of the type 25 browser interface and the reader-friendliness of category 8 device type to identify factors that attract customers and improve service quality.</p>
                                                <p style = "font-size: 16px">The model identified position, HistCTR, category, price, and title as important variables that influence click events. The company can focus on these variables to increase the click rate, which ultimately leads to higher ad visibility and profitability.</p>

                                                <hr style="border-top: dashed 2px #964B00;">
                                                <p style = "font-size: 16px">In the future, additional work can be done to improve the analysis. One possible step is to locate the missing column that records user phone requests in the "combined_stream" dataset. This column can be used as the label class to be predicted. Relevant datasets can be joined with "combined_stream," and variables that may help predict the label can be selected. Transformers and Encoders can be used to prepare the data for model training.</p>
                                                <p style = "font-size: 16px">If it is a binary classification problem, the logistic regression model can be used. For multiple classification problems, decision trees and random forests are viable options. Model accuracy can be evaluated based on metrics such as AUC. This will help to identify the significant factors that affect click events on both contextual and non-contextual ads. The company can then take steps to increase click rates and attract more product companies to post advertisements on the website.</p>
